      <p>I am a first generation Dominican-American. I was born in Miami, and my family moved to Orlando when I was 16 years old. 
        I graduated from UCF with a Bachelor of Science in Psychology in 2020, and a Master in Educational Leadership this past August 2022. 
        My husband is currently active-duty Navy, so we live in San Diego, California. We have 4 children ages 3, 5, 9, and 16. 
        Since we moved here in 2018 I have focused on my family and furthering my education.</p>
      <p>I have been wanting to enroll in a coding bootcamp for a few years, and I recently decided to take the leap and make the change. 
        I am excited to finally begin the program and learn. I know it will be challenging at times, but I have done nothing but challenge myself 
        the last 4 years being a stay-at-home mom and wife while also juggling being a full-time student. So... I know I can do this! :)</p>
